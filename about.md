Hi,

My name is Rob Lazzurs and I have been busy for just over the last two decades helping people with their computer problems.

For the most of this I have done this via automating away the work I have to do, I like to think if I ever manage to do my job well enough there won't be a job for me anymore.

I have always tried to do this by listening to the people and working hard to try and use the best open solutions to their problems.

Here I am going to keep some notes on some of the historical and more recent work I have done in hopes it might help someone else trying to solve the same problems for other people.

Thanks for listening.
