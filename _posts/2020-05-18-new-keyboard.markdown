Like most people I have been working from home recently.

In the past I have done plenty of work from home and it is generally my preferred
way of working. I have a nice setup at home and good internet and it means I can
have home cooked food for lunch and some flexibility around things like getting
deliveries and other general life tasks.

However this time I was presented with a problem I have not had before. Just over
a year ago my partner and I had a small baby boy. We also moved to a smaller
house in Dublin which is great but has meant rather than my study being down the
hall it is just across from his bedroom. This was all fine until working late one
night on a release and my noisy mechanical keyboard a [Pok3r RGB][pok3r-rgb]
managed to wake him up. Well it was either that or me talking and I am blaming
the keyboard.

This meant I of course had to go and get a new keyboard. In the far distant past
I was quite a fan of IBM, Dell and then Microsoft keyboards but after getting my
[Pok3r RGB][pok3r-rgb] I knew there was no looking back. It has the
[Cherry MX Blue][cherry-mx-blue] switches and it makes a lovely noise when typing.
So much so when I did try and take it into a shared office it was quickly made
clear it was not as popular as I was. This time given I was looking for something
quieter I decided to have a look at the [Cherry MX Brown][cherry-mx-brown]
switches which have been surprisingly hard to get a hold of. I can only assume I
am not the only person having this problem.

I managed to find the [Ducky One 2 TKL Skyline][ducky-keyboard] in stock at
[Box][box] and got a really quick delivery to Ireland given the circumstances.
I have just typed this post on it and I can say I am a fan. I decided on the TKL
because I wanted my arrow keys back and while it is now an adjustment I am sure
I will quickly get used to it again.

Peace, love and happiness.
