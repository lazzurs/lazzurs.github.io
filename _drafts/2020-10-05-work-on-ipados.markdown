Since the first iPad I have always liked the hardware format. Of course part of that is very likely to have been finally 
having a device in my hands that was like something out of Star Trek. It was the first Apple device I had ever bought for 
myself and it did not last long, While I did like the hardware and found that handing it to friends to show them 
something was just far more natural than handing them a laptop the device frustrated me. It was the first computer that
I had used that was mostly closed to me and unlike the Linux computers I had been using for a long time I did not have
the debugging tools I was used to. The best example of this was my early use of AirPlay. I had a few friends around and
we were watching TED videos. We would select one and then pass the iPad to the next person to allow a fair selection of
videos and then suddenly AirPlay to the Apple TV just stopped working. It was frustrating and yet amusing. There was
nothing I could do to find out what the problem was. I rebooted the iPad, the Apple TV and even the WiFi access point but
it changed nothing and for what ever reason our TED watching was ended early that night. 

 


Peace, love and happiness.
