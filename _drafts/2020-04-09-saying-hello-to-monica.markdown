A while back I had seen mention of Monica App and it seemed like just what I had been looking for.

For other people they use something like Facebook to keep a track of what the people around them are doing, when the
kids birthdays are coming up and so on but I am just not comfortable with the trade that comes with using Facebook. To
use Facebook you have to give them access to all of the information on the platform that you use, see and upload. They
of course are happy to leave you with ownership of your data because it is not the data its self they need. It's the
information generated from how you use that data and how you interact with other people. With this data they can boil
people down to predictable consumers and sell access to those people to anyone and help them influence the people that
use the platform. Better people than I have written about this issue so I am not going to go too deeply into this, just
providing context.

What I do however have then is a gap in my abilities to remember. Our brains are utterly useless at remembering
information and yet computers are great at this. One of my favourite time management books
[Time Management for System Administrators][time-management-sys-admins] covers this really well, in the book it talks
about your brain lying to you saying it will remember things and yet can't. It is just not designed that way. This is
where [Monica][monica] comes in. It is an app that remembers for you all of the small personal details about the people
around you that platforms like Facebook would usually provide to you that you want to remember like kids names or
anniversaries but your brain is never going to manage to remember.

This blog is not for



Peace, love and happiness.
