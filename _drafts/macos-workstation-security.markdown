I have noticed over the years when I start talking about workstation security with people I work with generally I get
some strange reactions. I do my best to keep my workstation secure. There is good reason for this in my humble opinion
as I am clearly a target. I have worked in governments, banking and telecoms and due to the nature of my work I tend to
have escalated privileged that attackers of those organisations would love to have and it has been shown in the past
that [people like me are a target][administrators-at-risk]

Below are some notes on the steps I try and take to reduce the risk of the access I have being exploited by someone 
else.

## Updates

First off updates are the single most important thing you can do to keep your systems secure. As soon as a security 
patch is out a very wide group of people start working on ways to exploit that issue. Updates are easy to apply and 
not doing so only carries risk.

Yes there will be times when installing an update will cause something to break but not patching means I know something
is broken.

### Operating system updates

### Software management

## Security settings

I use macOS for my daily workstation. From a security perspective this does make me itch slightly as it is a closed
source system so the number of people able to audit the source code is far lower than a system like Linux. The best 
I can do here is make sure the correct security settings are applied and hope that Apple have done their job. It is 
worth keeping in mind that while Apple does make privacy and security one of their selling points they have been shown
to be [willing to compromise][apple-fbi-icloud-security] on this when pushed by the government of their head office.

## Disk encryption

## Backups

## Password management

Peace, love and happiness.
